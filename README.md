# lightfeather_webserver
Webserver from Question 1 of the Coding Challenge

In order to run this server, open a terminal window and point to the location the app.py file is stored in your file directory. Then run python app.py. It should be open on port 23456. Next, I used the Postman app to send post requests to this server, which the server then should return a json object.
