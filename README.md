# lightfeather_webserver
Webserver from Question 1 of the Coding Challenge

In order to run this server, open a terminal window and point to the location the app.py file is stored in your file directory. Then run 'python app.py'. It should be open on port 23456 -- port 23456 doesn't work on my computer and instead I had to use port 80 to send requests. Next, I used the Postman app to send post requests to http://localhost/api/encode, which the server then should return a json object.
